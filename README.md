## Building with docker

The simplest (but not fastest for the first time launching) way to build application from sources is to execute command from nested directory *docker*:

      > docker-compose run build_all

To do this, You only will need installed docker daemon and docker-compose on your machine. You can download latest versions by this links:

Code was tested with Docker version 20.10.7 and docker-compose version 1.29.2
